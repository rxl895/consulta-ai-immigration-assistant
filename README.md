# 🧠 Consulta AI Immigration Assistant

A working prototype of an AI-powered assistant that answers U.S. immigration-related queries using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**. Built with `LangChain`, `FAISS`, and `Streamlit`, the assistant helps users get accurate, grounded responses from official sources like USCIS.

> ⚡ Designed in alignment with Consulta's mission to merge law, automation, and AI for impactful immigration solutions.
